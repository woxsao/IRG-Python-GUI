## Setup
- Put the Python implementation folder at the same level as the dsltl folder
- Put the filereshape file in the python implementation folder into the dsltl folder

## How to use:
### Python end:
- Run CursorGUI.py
- Drag and click to draw trajectory
- Release when done with trajectory
- Draw as many as you would like
- When you have as many trajectories as you'd like, hit the key "d" to save
- If you ever make a mistake and want to clear the data, hit the key "c" to clear.
### Matlab end:
- Run filereshape.m (this reshapes the .mat files properly)
- Run the learning/load segments!
